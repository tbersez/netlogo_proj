# Patern formation in discrete space and time model with two diffusing morphogenes
*Postgraduate students project at Paris Saclay University*
### Abstract
Various biological processes are regulated by diffusion of chemicals. Those can interact in complex systems. In this work
we have implemented a Gierer and Meinhardt model in discrete space and time on the Netlogo platform. Our model allow the simulation of diffusion in a 2 dimensional space with heterogeneous parameters. Several simulation with different parameters where run. Our results show the importance of spatially changing diffusion coefficients in the formation of complex, wet periodical, patterns.
